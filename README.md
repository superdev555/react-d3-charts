# React-NVD3-Graph-Application

My simple starter kit which I'd love to share to the community. The project was generated from `create-react-app` and then I included a few libraries.

## Features Out-Of-The-Box

* React-Router 4
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* Styled-Components
* ESlint
* Airbnb's ESlint rules

## Installation

Clone repo and run:

```
yarn && yarn start
```
